\section{Reproducing BBR Evaluation}

\para{Goal} What subset of results did you choose to reproduce?

The main result we focused on reproducing is the comparison between
CUBIC and BBR and how their performance varies across different loss
rate.

This result can be seen in  Figure~\ref{fig:bbr8}.

\para{Motivation} Why that particular choice?

We chose this result because it is a good representative summary
that captures the primary essence of the paper. This is that
loss-based congestion control schemes such as CUBIC are non-optimal
because their use of packet loss as a signal for congestion makes them
very sensitive to any (regular) packet loss that occurs on a path and it
also contributes to buffer bloat which increases latency.
