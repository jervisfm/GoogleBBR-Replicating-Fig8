\section{Reproducing BBR Results}

\para{Goal}
\emph{What subset of results did you choose to reproduce?}

The main result we focused on reproducing is the comparison between
CUBIC and BBR and how their performance varies across different loss
rate (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bbr8}, which appears as Figure 8 in the
original paper).

Our goal is to not only verify the behavior of BBR compared to CUBIC in
networks with various loss rates, but also explore the parameters of this
particular experiment.

\para{Motivation}
\emph{Why that particular choice?}

We chose this result because it is one of the primary results of the paper,
and is a large contributing factor of BBR's ability to better utilize
network infrastructure (as seen in Google's B4 deployment). It is also one
of the stronger claims of the paper, which shows that BBR differs significantly
from the behavior of CUBIC, a loss-based congestion control algorithm and the
current default in Linux.
